The whole point is starting from the right top corner and do a staricase search if the value is target then return the target or if the target value is lesser then current decrease the column go column wise left side <---- cause lesser values are left side of the current pointer
If the target value is greater than the current pointer then move downward
check edge case if the matrix is not and return false
